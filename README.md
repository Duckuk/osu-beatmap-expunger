## Osu Beatmap Filter  
This is a python script that can scan your osu songs folder for beatmaps that match the tags specified and relocate them to another directory. Hooray if this ends up being useful to someone other than myself :P  
### Usage  
Customize the options in `settings.py` to your liking then run `osu beatmap filter.py`.
